      <h1>Define Your <span class="accent">WHO</span></h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Your WHO is your internal identity made up of your Values, Pillars and Ideal Emotion. It appears when you are operating at your best self. (Your external identity are your physical attributes, accolades, job title, family titles [someone's child, spouse, sibling, parent]).
      </p>

      <p class="lead">
        This guided WHO Assessment helps you identify:
      </p>

      <ul class="hero-list">
        <li><b>Values</b> — your non-negotiables and how you think the world should act. It is your daily compass.</li>
        <li><b>Pillars</b> — your best-self characteristics. It is how you 'show up' when the world is not watching.</li>
        <li><b>Ideal Emotion</b> — what you want to feel every day.</li>
        <li><b>Trigger</b> — the inner critic that pulls you off course ("I'm not...enough").</li>
      </ul>

  <!-- ===== HOW IT WORKS ===== -->
  <section id="how" class="section">

      <h2>How it works</h2>

      <ol class="how-list">
        <li>
          <b>Values are the core essence of who you are. They are the fuel that propels you to act. When you are living in alignment with your Values, they are what helps you to achieve your goals. There are two ways to uncover your Values (1) what is your proudest moment from your childhood/adulthood and (2) what makes you upset. (Discover)</b><br/>
          Use real moments (proud + upset) to surface what truly matters to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Values (Road Test)</b><br/>
          If someone crosses your Values, does it evoke an emotion? YES = Value. NO = move to Pillars.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Pillars</b><br/>
          Identify the characteristics you embody when you’re the happiest and most “you.” If you took away any of these characteristics, would you still be you (or would you operate as a shell of yourself)?
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ideal Emotion</b><br/>
          Choose the feeling that you want to feel each day — and rate (realistically) how strongly you want to feel this emotion (1–10).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Trigger</b><br/>
          Name your loud “I’m not ___” inner critic. When something happens that activates the Trigger, you feel demoralized.

        This is your current snapshot — revisit the words of your WHO whenever you are not feeling your Ideal Emotion at the level you stated. Identify which Value or Pillar needs to be fed. Note your WHO words and have external and internal component. Externally, and if empathy was a Value, you can dial up empathy for others. Internally, how do you dial up empathy for yourself?
